Second public beta of CodexPill.

### Added

  animation preferences.
- Local Codex session token history aggregation for recent usage windows.

  session files.

### Changed

- Migrated the app and tests to Swift 6 language mode.
- Reduced status item background polling.
- Improved README install copy and release documentation.

### Fixed

- Token Usage refreshes now reuse cached all-time peak and unchanged file
  contributions instead of repeatedly scanning the full transcript history.
- Token Usage keeps the previous chart visible while a refresh is in progress.
- Token Usage menu progress updates no longer rebuild the menu while it is open
  or closed until the next safe refresh point.
- Remote host and menu validation tests were stabilized.
- Legacy remote host settings are cleared safely.
- Weekly limit windows tolerate near-weekly reset timings.
- Native menu quit alignment was corrected.
