## What It Does

- See your Codex limits at a glance.
- Switch between saved Codex accounts.
- Add accounts without disrupting your current session.
- Use selected accounts on SSH hosts you configure.
- Stay local-first: no cloud sync, no hidden browser automation, no account data upload.

## Install

Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask raphhgg/tap/codexpill
```

Or download the latest zip from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/raphhgg/CodexPill/releases).

## Build From Source

Prerequisites:

- macOS with Xcode command line tools installed.
- Tuist installed locally.
- Codex installed and signed in on this Mac.

Build and run:

```bash
tuist generate --no-open
make build
./scripts/run_menubar.sh
```

For release maintainers, the signed public beta artifact is produced with:

```bash
make package-release
```

That command requires local Developer ID signing and notarization setup before
it creates a public release artifact. See [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)
for maintainer packaging details.

## Prerequisite

Codex must already be installed and signed in on your Mac, either through the
Codex app, the Codex CLI or both.

## Local-First

CodexPill works with Codex state on your Mac and the SSH hosts you configure. It
does not run a cloud service.

Saved accounts stay on your Mac under
`~/Library/Application Support/CodexPill`. They contain authentication material,
so treat them like credentials.

CodexPill does not use browser cookies, hidden browser windows, Full Disk
Access, Screen Recording or Accessibility permissions for normal use.
