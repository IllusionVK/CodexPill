# Uninstall And Reset

Use this if you want to remove CodexPill or clear its saved beta state.

## Uninstall The App

1. Quit CodexPill from the menu bar.
2. Delete `CodexPill.app` from `Applications` or wherever you installed it.

This removes the app but keeps saved CodexPill accounts for a future reinstall.

## Clear CodexPill State

Only do this if you want to delete CodexPill's saved accounts, snapshots, and
preferences from this Mac:

```sh
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/CodexPill"
defaults delete com.raphhgg.codexpill
```

It is fine if `defaults delete` says the domain does not exist.

This does not delete `~/.codex/auth.json`. Do not remove or edit that file unless
you intentionally want to sign out of Codex or repair Codex itself.

## Remote Hosts

If you used remote hosts, CodexPill may have copied selected snapshots to:

```text
~/.codexpill/snapshots
```

On each remote host, remove CodexPill-owned remote state only if you no longer
need it:

```sh
rm -rf "$HOME/.codexpill"
```

Do not delete `$HOME/.codex/auth.json` on a remote host unless you intentionally
want to sign out of Codex on that host.

## Sensitive Reports

Report privately if uninstalling or resetting reveals account mix-ups, misplaced
snapshots, auth data, tokens, private hostnames, or private paths.
